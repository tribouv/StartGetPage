To create a new life, we must create a new folder with the name of the view like this one and create a file "default.php".
It is possible to make "in-order" by creating a file with a name lambda.

We can test the example folder and file as "examplesubfile.php" returning the following address: 

"localhost/?page=example&index=examplesubfile".
